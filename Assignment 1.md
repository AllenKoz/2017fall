I have taken nearly all of the required computer science classes, with the exception of Digital logic, projects and language processing. Before I transferred to New Paltz I went to Ulster. I took an intro to web programming class there and enjoyed it. We mostly went over HTML and CSS but we also did some JavaScript and some ruby on rails. 

Web programming is one the programming skills I enjoy the most. I am not necessarily aiming for a web programming job but I would take it even the chance. Outside of that I would use the skills I learn to make different websites for fun. I don’t have any ideas for a site right now but I can’t say I wouldn’t make one for my friends so we could do something together on the site.
